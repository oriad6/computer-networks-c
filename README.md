# Computer Networks Project
A modular C project developed as part of a first-year Computer Science course: Advanced Programming in C.
Implementation of computer network communication,  including construction of a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm,  network path building, and path search between computers using Depth-First Search (DFS).  The project demonstrates data structures, graph traversal,  and efficient network cost minimization.
