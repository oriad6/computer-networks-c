# computer-networks-c
Implementation of computer network communication in C,  including construction of a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm,  network path building, and path search between computers using Depth-First Search (DFS).  The project demonstrates data structures, graph traversal,  and efficient network cost minimization.
